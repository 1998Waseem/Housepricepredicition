<h1>House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning</h1>

<h2>STEP 1: Develop and Train the model</h2>
<p>The problem which i have selected is name as "House Price Prediction" is the supervised Machine learning so for solving this problem I am using linear Regression model for this. Following are the some important point realted to train the model</p>
<ul>
  <ol><p>Dowload the provided .ipynb file and dataset</p></ol>
   <ol><p>Upload the .ipynb in Googlecolab</p></ol>
   <ol><p>Upload the .CSV dataset on google drive</p></ol>
   <ol><p>Then Run each cell one by one</p></ol>
   <ol>In Last the model will provide you the .pkl file which you will be used in your GUI </ol>
</ul>

<br>

<h2>STEP 2: Create a GUI Application</h2>
<p>For create GUI application first you should follow the following points</p>
<ul>
  <ol>First download the python.exe file from <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">pyhton.org</a></ol>
  <ol>Then run it and install it as normal software</ol>
  <ol>Then set it as environmental variable (Take help from Youtube)</ol>
  <ol>In provided file there file name as main.py is the GUI application file </ol>
  <ol>For running UI file you have to install these libraries in next point</ol>
  <ol>pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn</ol>
  <ol>For installing pip copy the code from this link <a href="https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py.">https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py.</a> and save it in get-pip.py</ol>
  <ol>Then run this command for installing the pip " py get-pip.py"</ol>
  <ol>Once install the pip then you can able to install all necessary libraries</ol>
  <ol>After all libraries are installed then run main.py to run your project by running this command "py main.py"</ol>
</ul>

<h2>STEP 3: Run the GUI Application</h2>
<p>In GUI Application there are following options</p>
<ul>
  <ol>Download or save these files in .zip file</ol>
  <ol>Input fields for enter the data</ol>
  <ol>Button of load dataset in .csv format</ol>
  <ol>Button for train the model</ol>
  <ol>Button for Predict price</ol>
  <ol>Button for visualize the result</ol>
  <ol>Option for Prediction Result</ol>
  <ol>Option forEvaluation Metrics</ol>
</ul>

<p>First you need to upload the dataset in .csv format by clicking on Load the dataset button. Once the dataset will successfully upload then click on train the model button. Then enter the data input field and click on predict the price. The Result will be display infront of "Prediction Result" label. Then click you can click on visualize Result of looking the chart view </p>

<p>By Following all these Steps you can Develop you <b>"Machine learning base House Price Prediction Application"</b><br>For Further help you can contact me at any time</p>
